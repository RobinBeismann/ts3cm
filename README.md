A little script which enables teamspeak users to obtain their own channels on a public teamspeak

You need the TS3 PHP Framework from https://www.planetteamspeak.com/downloads/

Put it under /TeamSpeak3.

Please note, that this should be ported to MySQLI and cleaned up before being used.
This was a quick and dirty script, which works but could be faster.
